# Validator
A validator has two main responsibilities to propose or produce blocks known as beacon blocks, which contain consensus information about shards across the network or to attest (or vote on) the validity of blocks that have already been produced. They receive either rewards or penalties to the initial deposit based upon their overall performance. 

A validator will be allowed to participate if 32 ETH are being locked in a [validator deposit contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa). After that it will have to wait for at least four epochs before activation to prevent the manipulation of the random beacon (RANDAO) that selects validators. [More information about the validation lifecycle](https://notes.ethereum.org/@hww/lifecycle#4-Validator-lifecycle).
